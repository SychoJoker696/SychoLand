Hi, and welcome to my wonderful land of craziness. My name is Dakota Hinshaw. I am currently working a minimum wage job, but I am working towards a video game design degree.

At creation of this (2022), I am 21 years old, and I have a long road to travel before I'm ready for the big leagues.

My nicknames are Koda, Percy, and Sycho. The first nickname is self explanitory, but the second and third, I'm sure, are a little confusing. I pkan on changing my name 
to Perseus Percival Hinshaw. The nickname "Sycho" is a reference to my gaming style. I run head first into trouble in almost every video game I play, as well my eratic
methods when a game angers me, which is what has earned me the nickname Sycho.
